# -32-bit-RISC-V-Cpu-Design-Verilog
This RISCV CPU Architecture is designed on the efficient and effective operation of all instructions. However, for simulation purposes, a processor that can work with 15 instructions has been designed. The designed processor produces the correct output for all the specified instructions in a single cycle.
